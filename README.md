Geostatistical Basemap in R

In this repository is it covered the most basic elements for the creation and forther use of the geoestatitical basemap using as an input some shapefiles.

In this context we are using some files from our case study, but using data and code provided in this repository all of the results are reproducible to any other geographical area. We are using Nova Scotia Province in Canada.

Briefly technical comment as an introduction is following:

Geostatistical algorithms are incorporated in many places, including geographic information systems (GIS) and the R statistical environment.

In many of the scholar papers the concept of Geostatistics hase been defined and in general knowledge Geostatistics is a branch of statistics focusing on spatial or spatiotemporal datasets. It is currently applied in diverse disciplines including hydrography, oceanography, geochemistry, geometallurgy, geography, forestry, environmental control, landscape ecology, petroleum geology, hydrogeology, hydrology, meteorology, soil science, and agriculture. 

Geostatistics is applied in varied branches of geography, particularly those involving the spread of diseases (epidemiology), the practice of commerce and military planning (logistics), and the development of efficient spatial networks. 

Starting point for the graphical display of the geoestatistical basemap as a first approach to the Geoaestatitical in any case study. This code allows you to gain confidency in the use of  diverse range of geographical and non-geographical datasets into meaningful analyses and visualisations.
